##DDSPC Maker Group Education and Outreach

The DDPSC Maker Group develops low-cost research tools (in our spare time) and are keen to share our
experiences with others. We are actively developing lesson plans and [tutorials](http://maker.danforthcenter.org/pages/tutorials/)
so please check back with us frequently. The best way to keep up with what's going on with the Maker Group right this minute is to follow us on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/ddpscmaker). If you are interested in collaborating with us on outreach projects, don't hesitate to [contact us](http://maker.danforthcenter.org/pages/contact.html)!
